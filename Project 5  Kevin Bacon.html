<h2>Movie Distance and Kevin Bacon</h2>

<p>
The Kevin Bacon game is this: given an actor by name, what is his/her Kevin
Bacon number? 
</p>
<p>
To solve this we first need a clear definition of the Kevin Bacon number for an
actor, or more generally, the <i>movie distance</i> between two actors. The
definition is much like the path distance between two vertices in a graph,
except using <i>movie chains</i> instead of edges.

</p><blockquote><p>

A <i>movie chain</i> from actor <i>x</i> to actor <i>y</i> is a sequence <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>
<i>m</i><sub>2</sub> ... <i>m</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> such that 
<ol>
<li><i>m</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> and <i>m</i><sub><i>j</i>+1</sub> have an actor
in common for 0 &lt; <i>j</i> &lt; <i>k</i> </li>
<li><i>x</i> is in movie <i>m</i><sub>1</sub></li>
<li><i>y</i> is in movie <i>m</i><sub><i>k</i></sub></li>
</ol>

</p></blockquote><p>

</p><blockquote><p>
The <i>movie distance</i> md(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) is defined to be the number of movies
in a shortest movie chain from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>. If there is no movie chain
from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>, we define md(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = infinity.
</p>
<p>
The Kevin Bacon number of
an actor <i>x</i> is the movie distance from <i>x</i> to Kevin Bacon.
</p></blockquote><p>
Some consequences are:
<ol>
<li>Kevin Bacon has Kevin Bacon number 0.</li>
<li>In general, md(<i>x</i>,<i>x</i>) = 0 for any actor <i>x</i>.
<li>All other actors have Kevin Bacon number at least 1.</li>
<li>In general, if <i>x</i> != <i>y</i> and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are actors in the same movie, then md(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) = 1</li>
<li>Movie distance satisfies the triangle inequality: md(<i>x</i>,<i>z</i>) &lt;= md(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) + md(<i>y</i>,<i>z</i>) </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>The actor-movie graph</h2>

<p>
To solve the Kevin Bacon game (or any other similar game based on another actor)
we use graphs. Specifically, create a graph in which both actors and movies are
vertices, and insert an edge whenever an actor is in a movie. Thus each edge has
an actor for one vertex and a movie for the other.
</p>
<p>
A graph is said to be <i>bipartite</i> if the vertices can be colored
with two colors, say red and blue, such that each edge has different colored
vertices, that is, each edge goes between a blue vertex and a red
vertex. Clearly the movie-actor graph is bipartite, with actors colored blue and
movies colored red. 
</p>
<p>
The following result is proved in discrete math courses and most books on graph theory:
</p>
<p>
<b>Theorem.</b> In a bipartite graph, a path whose ends have the same color has
an even number of edges.</p>
<p>
As a consequence, any path from one actor to another in the movie-actor graph
has an even number of edges. If <i>P</i> is such a path, with length <i>n</i>,
then <i>n</i> is even and <i>n</i>/2 is the number of movies passed through by
<i>P</i>. If <i>P</i> is a shortest path from actor <i>x</i> to actor
<i>y</i>, then <i>n</i>/2 is the movie distance from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>. 
(Note, in passing, that the path <i>P</i> has an <i>odd</i> number of vertices.)
</p>
<p>
Thus to solve the Kevin Bacon game, we perform a Breadth-First survey from Kevin
Bacon. The Breadth First Search Tree rooted at Kevin Bacon consists of shortest paths
from Kevin Bacon to all other actors who have a finite Kevin Bacon
number. Dividing the length of such a path by 2 yields the Kevin Bacon number
for the actor at the other end of the path.
</p>
<p>
In practical terms, we start at an actor <i>x</i> and follow the parent vertices
of the BFS tree back to Kevin Bacon, counting the steps. Then divide this count
by 2 to get the number.
</p>
<p>
Note that the path itself provides documentation in the form of a list starting
with <i>x</i> and then listing movie | actor in pairs until we are back to
Kevin Bacon.
</p>

<h2>Code Requirements and Specifications - MovieMatch</h2>

<ol>

<li><p>
MovieMatch should, at a minimum, provide services required by <tt>kb.cpp</tt>. This
will require the following (partial) class definition:
</p><pre>// types used
typedef uint32_t                           Vertex;
typedef fsu::String                        Name;
typedef fsu::ALUGraph &lt;Vertex>             Graph;
typedef fsu::BFSurvey &lt;Graph>              BFS;
typedef hashclass::KISS&lt;Name>              Hash;
typedef fsu::HashTable&lt;Name,Vertex,Hash>   AA; // associative array
typedef fsu::Vector&lt;Name>                  Vector;

class MovieMatch
{
public:
       MovieMatch    ();
  bool Load          (const char* filename);
  bool Init          (const char* actor);
  long MovieDistance (const char* actor);
  void ShowPath      (std::ostream& os) const;
  void ShowStar      (Name name, std::ostream& os) const;
  void Hint          (Name name, std::ostream& os) const;
  void Dump          (std::ostream& os) const;
  ...
};
</pre>
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p></li>

<li><p>The underlying graph should be built from the
"database" provided in the text file <tt>movies.txt</tt>. Each line of this file
represents a movie and the actors in the movie. Forward slash <tt>'/'</tt> is
used to delimit the strings representing movie titles and actor names in each
line. 
</p></li>

<li><p>The following helper function makes reading a movie DB file
    somewhat straightforward:
</p><pre>private:
  static fsu::Vector&lt;Name> Line(std::ifstream& is)
  {
    fsu::String line;
    char delim = '/';
    line.GetLine(is);
    char* name_buffer = new char [1+line.Size()];
    size_t pos = 0, next = 0;
    fsu::Vector&lt;Name> movie;
    while (pos < line.Size())
    {
      next = line.Position(delim,pos);
      for (size_t i = pos; i < next; ++i)
      {
        name_buffer[i - pos]= line[i];
      }
      name_buffer[next-pos] = '\0';
      movie.PushBack(name_buffer);
      pos = ++next; // skip delimiter
    }
    delete [] name_buffer;
    return movie;
  }
...

</pre><p>
This function consumes a line of text from the stream and returns a vector whose
elements are the names delimited by '/'. The first element is then a movie title
and all other elements are actors in that movie. Note that you are not required
to use this - it can be optimized away - but it can be helpful in a draft to
postpone read issues until the main functionality is built. 
</p></li>

<li><p><b>bool Load (const char* filename)</b><br>
This method uses the data in the file to build the underlying symbol graph for
    the game. The symbol graph consists of these private members:
</p><pre>private:
  ...
  Graph  g_;
  Vector name_;
  AA     vrtx_;
  2...
</pre><p>
name_ is a mapping: {vertices} -> {names}, and vrtx_ is a mapping: {names} ->
{vertices}.  Even though Vector and AA are very different structurally, they
perform as mappings in the abstract, each using its bracket operator as function
evaluation. These mappings are required to be mutually inverses of the other:
For any vertex <tt>v</tt>, <tt>vrtx_[name_[v]] == v</tt> and for any name <tt>n</tt> <tt>name_[vrtx_[n]] == n</tt>.
</p><p>
Load must look at each name encountered (movie or actor) and, if and only if
that name is not already encountered, record it as a new vertex. Then Load must
add an edge <tt>[a,m]</tt> to <tt>g_</tt> whenever <tt>a</tt> is an actor in movie <tt>m</tt>.
</p><p>
It is advisable to allow Load to read the file twice: First to establish the
vertices and the two mappings <tt>vrtx_</tt> and <tt>name_</tt>; and second to insert all of the
edges. Function <tt>Line()</tt> will be handy for these steps.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>bool Init(const char* actor)</b><br>
This method establishes actor as the base actor in the game (i.e., the "Kevin
Bacon") and performs a BFS from the base actor in the graph. This BFS 
    searches only from the base_actor vertex (not a full survey) and records
    all the parent info for use later during game play. The BFS survey data is
    thus required to be persistent, so it is maintained as a BFSurvey object:
</p><pre>private:
  ...
  BFS bfs_;
  ...
</pre><p>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>long MovieDistance (const char* actor)</b><br>
This method uses the pre-computed BFS tree to (1) determine whether actor is in
    the DB and retrieve its vertex if so (<tt>if
      (vrtx_.Retrieve(actor,v))</tt>), (2) determine whether actor is reachable
    from the base actor (<tt>if (bfs_.Color()[v] == 'b')</tt>). In that case, it (3) computes
    the path from actor to base actor (storing the path as it goes) and returns
    the move distance. The path is stored in the class member
</p><pre>private:
  ...
  fsu::List&lt;Vertex>  path_;
  ...
</pre><p>
MovieDistance returns -3 when the entered name is not in the DB, -2 when the
name is
not reachable from the base actor, -1 when the name entered is a movie (not an
actor), and otherwise the movie distance between
actor and base_actor.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>void ShowPath (std::ostream& os) const</b><br>
This method outputs the entire path as an actor-movie chain connecting actor_to
    baseActor_ This is used to document the movie distance number. See <tt>area51/kb.x</tt>
    for suggested behavior.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>void ShowStar (Name name, std::ostream& os) const</b><br>
This method outputs the name stored in actor_ (which might be a movie...)
    followed by the names of all vertices that are adjacent to actor_ in the
    graph. This is implemented using an AdjIterator:
</p><pre>    typename fsu::ALUGraph<Vertex>::AdjIterator i;
</pre><p>
    See <tt>area51/kb.x</tt> for suggested behavior.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>void Hint (Name name, std::ostream& os) const</b><br>
This method provides hints intended to be helpful when a name is not found in
    the DB. See <tt>area51/kb.x</tt> for one idea on behavior.
 </p></li>

<li><p><b>void Dump (std::ostream& os) const</b><br>
This method, as expected, depicts the internal structure of the MovieMatch
    objects. The demonstration program <tt>area51/kb.x</tt> uses this implementation:
</p><pre>
  void Dump(std::ostream& os)
  {
    ShowAL(g_,os);
    WriteData(bfs_,os);
    vrtx_.Dump(os);
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; name_.Size(); ++i)
    {
      os &lt;&lt; "name_[" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "] = " &lt;&lt; name_[i] &lt;&lt; '\t';
      os &lt;&lt; "vrtx_[" &lt;&lt; name_[i] &lt;&lt; "] = " &lt;&lt; vrtx_[name_[i]] &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
    vrtx_.Analysis(std::cout);
}
</pre><p>
<tt>ShowAL</tt> and <tt>WriteData</tt> are in <tt>graph_util.h</tt> and <tt>survey_util.h</tt>,
respectively. <tt>vrtx_.Dump()</tt> and <tt>vrtx_.Analysis()</tt> are calls to the HashTable
API. The for loop shows the two mappings. Every one of these has proved helpful
tracking down a bug!
</p></li>

<li><p><b>kb.cpp</b><br>
This client program is supplied. Note that it utilizes the entire API discussed
    above. The program #includes source code for all helpers in the library, so
    it can be compiled with one call to g++.
</p></li>

</ol>


<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>
It is highly recommended to construct some tiny fake movies files. Spend a few
minutes creating these to model specifc cases of graph structure, accessibility,
and redundancy. Keep a hand drawing of the symbol graphs for these examples so
that the Dump output can be hand-traced. Note that Dump is called by kb.cpp when
there is a third command line argument:
</p><pre>
kb.x m_test.1 name   # runs kb.x with DB = m_test.1 and base actor = name 
kb.x m_test.1 name y # same as above, with a call to Dump after Load and Init
</pre><p>
It is also advisable to read the source code <tt>kb.cpp</tt> to understand what
it is asking your MovieMatch object to do.
</p></li>

<li><p>When you need a string with blanks in it to be read as a single command
    line argument, enclose it in single quotes:
</p><pre>
kb.x movies.txt 'Bacon, Kevin'  # runs kb.x with base actor = 'Bacon, Kevin' 
</pre><p>

</p></li>

<li><p>
Here is a partial list of technologies used in this project:
</p><pre>graphs
graph search &amp; survey
path computation in graphs
associative arrays [hash tables]
generic optimized quicksort
generic binary search
</pre><p>
(The last two are optionally used by Hint().)
</p></li>


<li><p>
Be careful to keep  in mind the dual personality of the AA bracket operator: aa[key]
behaves as "insert key" when key is not in the table. In a const environment you
are protected. The const bracket operator will be called and fail if you
accidentally use it in insert mode. You can use the const method
HashTable::Retrieve to probe whether a name is already a key in the
AA. Otherwise, it is advised to use the AA bracket operator for readability.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Load time can be an issue. kb.cpp has a built-in timer for the load operation, and
we'll run a contest of sorts on this measure. In designing your Load function,
be aware of runtime in every step of the plan. There are a lot of places
where choosing one direction over another can have a dramatic affect on Load time.
</p>
<p>
The supplied executable area51/kb.x requires about 0.41 seconds to load
movies_abbreviated.txt (190 movies and 10,190 actors) and 4.25 seconds
to load movies.txt (4,188 movies and 115,241 actors). Note that the two ratios
4.25/0.41 and (4188 + 115241)/(190+10190) are approximately equal, informally
indicating linear runtime growth. 
</p><p>
Nevertheless there are aspects to the Load process (as implemented for kb.x)
that can be optimized to reduce the load time.
</p></li>

<li><p> The implementation of Hint that is illustrated in area51/kb.x uses yet
another item we have worked on: g_quick_sort_3w_opt. This generic algorithm is
used to sort a vector hint_ which is built during the first read loop and
consists of all names (actor and movie names). This sort is done after the
graph has been established. (We do the sort as part of Init so it doesn't add to
Load runtime.)
</p>
<p>
Once hint_ is sorted, the generic binary search algorithms can be used to
locate small ranges in the vector surrounding an input name.
</p>
<p>
Hint() is needed because it is difficult to recall the exact name of an
actor. For example, "Wayne, John" is not found in the DB ... Huh? ... ok, the
hint shows us he is officially "Wayne, John (I)".
</p>
<p>
Note BTW that you can mouse-select an entire line of Hint output on screen and
"paste selection" will pipe the selection directly into input for a running kb.x.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Aside from bragging rights for "best load time" (self-reported on Blackboard),
style points can be awarded for "intuitive hints" (AI anyone?) and for finding
an actor with maximal Kevin Bacon number (again, self-report to Blackboard).
</p></li>

<li><p>
The Kevin Bacon number of an actor using movies_abbreviated.txt is not
necessarily the actual Kevin Bacon number. (Explain this.)
</p></li>



</ul>
